Your task is to assess the level of hallucination in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) output.

Rate how well the generated answer matches the context and question, without introducing false or unsupported information.

Give a score from 1 to 5:

1: The answer is made up or contradicts the context.
5: No hallucination, the answer is fully based on the context and correctly answers the question.
The response must be in JSON format with the following keys:

comment: (a sentence explaining the score)
hallucination_score: (a score between 1 and 5)
Return only the JSON object.

Context: {context}
