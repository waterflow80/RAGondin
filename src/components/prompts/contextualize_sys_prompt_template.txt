Analyze the conversation history and the question, which might reference to elements in conversation history.
* If the question is a follow-up to the history then formulate a standalone question that takes into account chat history and can be understood without the chat history.
* If the question isn't related to the chat history then, return is as it is.
Do NOT answer the question. Your response should only be the reformulated question, without any additional text.
