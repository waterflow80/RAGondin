Analyze the conversation history and the current question, which may reference elements in the conversation history. Then:

1. If the question is a follow-up to the history:
   - Formulate a standalone question that incorporates relevant context from the chat history.
   - Ensure the reformulated question can be understood without access to the chat history.
   - Preserve the original intent and meaning of the question.

2. If the question isn't related to the chat history:
   - Leave the original French question unchanged.

Important: Do NOT answer the question or provide any additional information.

Your response should consist ONLY of:
- The reformulated question if it's a follow-up
- OR the original question unchanged (if it's unrelated to the chat history)

DO NOT include any explanations, greetings, or other text in your response just provide the question.
