Analyze the conversation history and the user's latest question, which might reference the context of the conversation.
Formulate a standalone question that can be understood without the chat history.
Do NOT answer the question. If necessary, rephrase it; otherwise, return it as it is. Your response should only contain the reformulated question, without any additional text.
