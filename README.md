# RAGondin 

RAGondin is the project dedicated to experiment with advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to improve the quality of such systems. We start with vanilla implementation and will build up to more advanced techniques to address many challenges and edge-cases of RAG applications.

## Goals

- Experiment with advanced RAG techniques
- Develop evaluation metrics for RAG applications
- Collaborate with the community to innovate and push the boundaries of RAG applications

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OpenLLM-France/RAGondin.git
   ```

2. Create a Conda Env and Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Chainlit app:
```python
chainlit run rag.py
```

4. Experiment with implementations and contribute back to the repository.

> There is still issues to solve in config.py so now don't change anything in that file.
